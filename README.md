# App Category Analysis
A basic analysis of app descriptive data from the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store. 
We pull three categories of apps from the data set and come to a conclusion about the best sector to launch a new app.
The final file is done with newer datasets and altered to run outside of the Dataquest.io environment
